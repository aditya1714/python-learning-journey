The donkey saw another donkey eating grass, so the first donkey thought, “That donkey looks happier than me.” Then the donkey walked closer to the other donkey and asked, “Hey donkey, why are you such a happy donkey?” The second donkey replied, “Because I stopped comparing myself to any other donkey. A donkey is a donkey — and that’s perfectly fine.”
