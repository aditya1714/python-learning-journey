## 🧠 Learning Strategy

✔ Watch the lecture  
✔ Write code myself  
✔ Solve practice problems without help  
✔ Compare with solution only if stuck  
✔ Rewrite the solution from memory  
✔ Improve by making variations of each problem  

**This method ensures understanding, retention, and real problem-solving ability — not just copying code.**
